# DiffFinder

DiffFinder (from **[rajeevboobna / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/rajeevboobna/shelvesetcomparer)**) extends the existing **[hamidshahid / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/hamidshahid/shelvesetcomparer)** Visual Studio extension.
ShelvesetComparer is a Visual Studio extension that allow users to compare contents of two shelvesets (from on or different users).

**DiffFinder** extends it to also

* allow comparison of a shelveset with current workspace local pending changes
* compare shelvesets targeting different branches, e.g. `$/BranchA/path/to/file1` with `$/BranchB/path/to/file1`

Color coding used in file comparison:

* **black**: no difference / both files are identical
* **red**: differences / both files differ
* **blue**: file exists only in one of the compared containers (Shelveset or Pending Changes)

   * Shelvesets with different paths (algorithm tries to find the best match (most common path parts)):
      * differerent branches but same relative path:

      * different branches and different paths:
