# Diff Finder

Diff Finder (from **[rajeevboobna / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/rajeevboobna/shelvesetcomparer)**) extends the existing **[hamidshahid / shelvesetcomparer](https://github.com/hamidshahid/shelvesetcomparer)** Visual Studio extension.
ShelvesetComparer is a Visual Studio extension that allow users to compare contents of two shelvesets (from on or different users).

**Diff Finder** extends it to also
* allow comparison of a shelveset with current workspace local pending changes
* compare shelvesets targeting different branches, e.g. $/BranchA/path/to/file1 with $/BranchB/path/to/file1
